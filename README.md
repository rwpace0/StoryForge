Welcome to StoryForge!

This project is designed to create a storyline for those that wish to kickstart their imagination
Using a combination of AI models to provide image and text generation and prompting them with an accurate speech to text model we managed to provide a simple way to fuel creative storytelling.

To run this project, you will need to open two terminals, using cd backend for one and cd frontend for the other.
In the backend terminal type "python main.py" (omit quotations) and in the frontend terminal type "npm run dev" (omit quotations).

Once you are running the project, in the frontend terminal you will need to ctrl+click on the localhost link that was just created.
This will open the page in your browser.

To use the application, simply type in a prompt for the kind of story you want or press the speech button to turn on the speech-to-text feature.
The speech-to-text will stop as soon as it detects that you stopped talking, but you can keep editting it with voice or manually wherever you want.

Once you are happy with your prompt, hit the generate button and wait for the models to complete their work.
The image and text will update simultaneously, and your storyline will be made.



Notes:
The program uses API keys linked to us, the creators. We did not want to pay the $9 fee for privacy protection in the domain we claimed so we did not want to risk putting those keys out in the internet.
One of these keys is not infinite and will innevitably break the program if used too many times. If testing is rigourous, please keep this in mind.
We did claim a domain, storyforge.tech, but it does not have any content and will go to the default lander since we did not want to risk linking anything important to an unprotected domain.
